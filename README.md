# **Online Poker, Blackjack, & Roulette**
I will create a server-based Poker, Blackjack, and Roulette website using HTML/CSS and JavaScript with a Node/Express server. It will consist of Three games that will allow the player to use chips that are given upon access to the website. The user will access said website and be given a certain number of chips that they can use to gamble on either Blackjack, Poker, or Roulette, they will also be able to choose what game they would like to play.

## **Plans**
  - Create a server-backed Poker website using Node/Express.
  - Provide users who visit with a standard amount of chips to use throughout the game.
  - Allow user to play poker and bet their own chips.
